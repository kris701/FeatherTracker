# Feather Tracker
This is a small project i made for me to keep track of my own parrots weight over time.
I also made so that other people can register themselfs into the website and use it to 
log their birds weights as well.

Currently, thats basically all it does, however i might extend it in the future.

Feel free to use [the website](https://feathertracker.dk) im hosting for this project.

## Implementation Details

The tech-stack is:
* Database: SQL Server 2022 using TSQL
* API:      ASP.NET Web API using .NET 9
